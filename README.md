# Biomimetic Inventions – Public Demos

> Rebrand note: This repository was originally drafted under the working name **Solaris**. As of January 20, 2026, the public-facing brand is **Phyllux** to better reflect its roots in phyllotaxis and light, and to avoid potential conflicts with existing software trademarks. Historical references to "Solaris" may remain in older documents or commit history to preserve prior-art continuity.

Discover an experimental portfolio of phyllotaxis-inspired engineering concepts, where nature's spiral patterns meet early-stage antenna, security, and neural-interface ideas. These materials present **toy demonstrations and visualizations only**; they are not production systems, medical devices, or commercial products.

## What is Biomimicry?

Biomimicry is the practice of learning from nature's proven designs to inform human technology. Classic examples include sunflower seed spirals, pinecone scales, and other patterns that approximate the golden angle and Fibonacci sequence. This repository explores how similar patterns might someday inform antennas, cryptographic schemes, and neural meshes—in a highly simplified, educational form.

## Featured Concept Demos

### Golden-Angle Fractal Antenna Array (GAFAA) - Phyllux Wave

Illustrative code and plots exploring phyllotactic spiral layouts for antenna element placement. These examples are intended to spark ideas about array geometry, not to specify any validated RF design or guaranteed performance.

### Phyllux Vault Geometric Security Protocol

Conceptual experiments with lattice growth and geometric path traversal. The aim is to visualize how spatial structure could inspire cryptographic thinking. These demos are **not** production-grade or security-reviewed cryptography and must not be used to protect real-world data.

> Note: The repository folder name `PhiKey-public` is retained for GitHub continuity and prior art preservation. This technology is now branded as **Phyllux Vault**.

### Phyllotactic Neural Meshing (PNM) - Phyllux Mesh

Simple visualizations of electrode layouts arranged using phyllotactic patterns. These are mathematical layouts only; they are **not** clinical devices, have not been tested in vivo or in humans, and make no medical performance claims.

## About the Inventor

**David Edward Sproule** is an independent inventor based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, exploring the intersection of biomimicry, geometry, and emerging technologies. Development of the underlying concepts, code, and documentation is currently a solo effort.

> Important: This repository intentionally exposes only **public, toy-level material**. More detailed embodiments, simulations, and potential patent filings—where applicable—are maintained separately to preserve intellectual property options.

## IP, Prior Art, and Licensing

This repository participates in the broader **Phyllux Framework**: a tiered licensing and prior-art strategy designed to balance openness for research with protection for commercial use.

### High-level status (informational only)

- Public disclosures have been made over the 2024–2026 period (e.g., social posts and Git commits).  
- Patent and trade-secret strategies are being explored for certain underlying concepts.  
- Nothing in this repository should be interpreted as legal advice or as a promise that patents have been granted.

### Use and Licensing

- **Research / education / personal tinkering:**  
  - Free of charge under the repository's code license (see `LICENSE`).  
  - Please provide appropriate attribution to this repository.

- **Commercial or product use:**  
  - Requires a separate license under the Phyllux Framework.  
  - Contact the inventor for discussion before incorporating any concepts into a commercial offering.

## 2. `README-ALT.md` (alternative intro)

```markdown
# Biomimetic Inventions – Alternative Overview

This alternative README presents the same repository from a slightly more narrative perspective. It is safe to share publicly and should always be interpreted as **conceptual and exploratory**, not as product documentation.

## From Solaris to Phyllux

Earlier drafts used the name **Solaris** to describe this family of biomimetic technologies. To avoid confusion with other software and to better reflect the focus on phyllotaxis ("phyl‑") and light ("‑lux"), the public brand is now **Phyllux**.

- "Solaris" may still appear:
  - In older files (e.g., `SOLARIS_PROJECT.md`).  
  - In Git history.  
  - In internal patent strategy documents.
- When in doubt, treat "Solaris Project" as a **historical name** for what is now called the **Phyllux Project**.

## What This Repository Is (and Is Not)

This repository **is**:

- A set of **concept demos and documents** exploring:
  - Phyllotactic electrode layouts (PNM / Phyllux Mesh).  
  - Phyllotactic antenna arrays (GAFAA / Phyllux Wave).  
  - Geometric key ideas for cryptography (Phyllux Vault).  
  - A high-level integrated system concept (Phyllux Core).  
- A way to establish **public prior art** around these ideas at a conceptual level.  
- A platform for others to **learn from and build upon** the geometric patterns, subject to licensing.

This repository is **not**:

- A substitute for **filed and granted patents**.  
- A set of **clinically validated medical devices** or **deployment-ready RF designs**.  
- A security-audited cryptographic library.  
- Legal, medical, or investment advice.

## Relationship to the Phyllux Framework

The **Phyllux Framework** is a broader umbrella that includes:

- Licensing models (research vs. commercial vs. mission-aligned use).  
- Philosophical context (e.g., PhiGenesis, 444 framework).  
- Additional documentation not mirrored here.

This `biomimetic-inventions-public` repository is the **technical, demo-focused edge** of that ecosystem. Most users can interact with this repository without needing to engage the deeper philosophical layer.

## How to Use This Repo Safely

1. **Treat everything as a starting point.**  
   - Any numerical performance values or metrics discussed in related docs should be assumed to be **simulated, theoretical, or aspirational** unless explicitly backed by published data.

2. **Do not deploy directly to safety-critical or security-critical environments.**  
   - No content here has been certified for clinical, regulatory, or cryptographic use.

3. **Reach out before commercial use.**  
   - Commercial users should contact the inventor to discuss licensing and risk mitigation.

## Where to Go Next

- High-level architecture and integrated concepts: `INTEGRATED_SYSTEM.md`  
- Prior art rationale and legal positioning: `PRIOR_ART.md` and `TIMESTAMP.md`  
- Broader Phyllux philosophy: `SOLARIS_PROJECT.md` (legacy manifest - historical reference)
