# Phyllux Biomimetic Inventions – Public Demos

Biomimetic multi-domain system fusing phyllotaxis (golden angle ~137.508°) with AI, biology, quantum for neural interfaces, wireless communications, cryptographic security, integrated tech.

**Provisional application prepared for filing Jan 21, 2026 – prior art established via commits (Jan 7, 2026), MIT as defensive publication, @Phibronotchi disclosures Jan 2026. Simulation-based; empirical validation required.**

## Ethical IP Tiers (Unified Across All Phyllux Repos)
1. Free Tier — Research, education, open-source contributions.
2. Commercial Tier — Fair royalties for profit use.
3. Pioneer Tier — Low/no-fee for high-impact players (sustainability, space, longevity orgs).
4. Community Defense — No misuse; revocation for bad faith; shared prosperity, no patent trolling.

## This Repo
Public demos and prior art for golden-angle antennas, neural meshes, Phyllux Vault crypto concepts, empirical simulations.

## Extensions as Embodiments (Unifying Other Inventions)
Extensions for biological (mycelium nets), AI/ML (mandelbrot optimizations), medical (neuroprosthetics), space (propulsion), etc. — unified under phyllotactic system per PPA embodiments.

## Featured Concept Demos

### Golden-Angle Fractal Antenna Array (GAFAA) - Phyllux Wave

Illustrative code and plots exploring phyllotactic spiral layouts for antenna element placement. These examples are intended to spark ideas about array geometry, not to specify any validated RF design or guaranteed performance.

### Phyllux Vault Geometric Security Protocol

Conceptual experiments with lattice growth and geometric path traversal. The aim is to visualize how spatial structure could inspire cryptographic thinking. These demos are **not** production-grade or security-reviewed cryptography and must not be used to protect real-world data.

> Note: The repository folder name `PhiKey-public` is retained for GitHub continuity and prior art preservation. This technology is now branded as **Phyllux Vault**.

### Phyllotactic Neural Meshing (PNM) - Phyllux Mesh

Simple visualizations of electrode layouts arranged using phyllotactic patterns. These are mathematical layouts only; they are **not** clinical devices, have not been tested in vivo or in humans, and make no medical performance claims.
