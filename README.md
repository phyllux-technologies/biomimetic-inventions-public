# Biomimetic Inventions – Public Demos 🌿

Discover an innovative portfolio of **phyllotaxis-inspired** engineering marvels, where nature's elegant patterns meet cutting-edge technology. This repository showcases public demos of biomimetic inventions that harness the golden ratio and spiral arrangements found in plants, animals, and natural phenomena to solve real-world challenges in antennas, security, and neural interfaces.

## What is Biomimicry?
Biomimicry is the art and science of imitating nature's proven designs to create sustainable, efficient solutions. Think of how sunflowers optimize seed packing or how pinecones follow the golden angle—these principles fuel the inventions here!

## About the Inventor
**David Edward Sproule** – An Edmonton-based independent inventor passionate about bridging biology and engineering. This is currently a solo project, with all development handled independently. By translating natural patterns like phyllotaxis and the golden angle, these concepts push boundaries in neural interfaces, antennas, and cryptography.

> **Note:** These are public toy demos only. Full specifications and implementations remain private to safeguard potential patents.
