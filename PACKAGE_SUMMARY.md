## 🔥 The Failsafe Explained

**INVENTORSHIP_DECLARATION.md is your secret weapon:**

- Written like a legal affidavit (under penalty of perjury)
- Declares sole inventorship with no exceptions
- Lists complete timeline with evidence
- Warns against false claims with legal consequences
- Can be submitted to patent office or court
- Creates public record anyone can verify

**If someone tries to:**
- Claim they invented it → Point to this declaration + prior art
- File patents on your work → Prior art dated Jan 2, 2025 blocks them
- Claim joint inventorship → Declaration explicitly denies any collaboration
- Steal your ideas → You have timestamped proof and legal declaration

**The formal legal language ("under penalty of perjury", "sole and original inventor", "legal consequences") is intentional - it shows you're serious and makes people think twice about misconduct.**

## 📋 File Upload Order

Upload in this order (doesn't really matter, but logical):

1. COPYRIGHT (foundational)
2. PRIOR_ART.md (legal basis)
3. INVENTION_DISCLOSURE.md (technical details)
4. PATENTS.md (licensing terms)
5. INVENTORSHIP_DECLARATION.md (failsafe)
6. README.md (homepage - best to update last)
7. SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md (helper - can skip if you want)

Or just upload all at once - Git doesn't care about order!
