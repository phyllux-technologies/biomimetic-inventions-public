# Prior Art Declaration – Biomimetic Inventions

> Rebrand note: Earlier drafts and related documents sometimes refer to a “Solaris” framework. That internal working name has been superseded publicly by **Phyllux**. References to “Solaris” are retained where necessary to maintain continuity of public disclosures and prior-art records.

This file summarizes the intent to establish public prior art for certain biomimetic concepts explored in this repository. It does **not** provide legal advice and does not replace formal patent filings.

## Covered Concept Areas

The following conceptual technologies are sketched or demonstrated in toy form within this repository:

- **Phyllotactic Neural Meshing (PNM):**  
  - Neural electrode array layouts inspired by golden-angle phyllotaxis.  
  - Intended benefits such as reduced crosstalk or tissue response are **design goals**, not verified clinical claims at this stage.

- **Golden-Angle Fractal Antenna Arrays (GAFAA):**  
  - Antenna element placements following sunflower-like spirals.  
  - Any performance numbers mentioned in related docs should be treated as **simulations or hypothetical targets**, not guaranteed specifications.

- **PhiKey (Geometric Security Concepts):**  
  - Conceptual mappings from geometric/spiral indices to cryptographic material.  
  - Demonstrations here are not audited cryptographic primitives and must not be used to secure real-world assets.

- **Integrated Biomimetic System (IBS / PhiNexus):**  
  - High-level concept of a system combining PNM, GAFAA, and PhiKey into one architecture.  
  - All system-level metrics should be regarded as **theoretical or simulated** until independently verified.

## Evidence of Public Disclosure (High Level)

Examples of channels that may contribute to prior art include:

- Commits and tagged releases in this GitHub repository.  
- Public posts or discussions describing these ideas in general terms.  
- Time-stamped documentation such as `TIMESTAMP.md` within this repo.

Exact legal effect depends on jurisdiction and timing; consult qualified counsel for any patentability or enforcement analysis.

## Legal Notice

- This document is intended to **record and summarize** the existence of public disclosures relating to the above concept areas.  
- It does **not** guarantee that any particular claim will be considered prior art, nor that any future patent filing will be valid or enforceable.  
- Anyone considering filing patents that cover similar subject matter should perform their own professional prior-art search and legal analysis.
