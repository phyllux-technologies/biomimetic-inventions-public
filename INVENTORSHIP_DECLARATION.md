## V. VERIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

### Cryptographic Proof

**Git Commit Hashes:** All commits have cryptographic SHA-1 hashes providing tamper-evident timeline

**To Verify First Disclosure:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phibronotchi-beep/biomimetic-inventions-public.git
cd biomimetic-inventions-public
git log --reverse --pretty=format:"%ai | %H | %s" | head -20
```

**Expected Result:** Commits dating to approximately January 2, 2025

### Independent Archival

**Planned Archives:**
- Zenodo DOI (CERN-backed permanent scientific record)
- Software Heritage (UNESCO-backed universal archive)
- Internet Archive Wayback Machine (independent snapshots)

These provide independent third-party verification that cannot be retroactively altered.
