# GAFAA – Overview (Public)

GAFAA explores antenna arrays inspired by natural phyllotactic spirals, where elements are arranged in a non‑periodic pattern around a center.

Key public ideas:

- Use **aperiodic** angular spacing to avoid simple grid‑based repetition.
- Investigate whether such layouts can soften grating lobes and mutual coupling compared with regular arrays.
- Study how **self‑similar / multi‑scale** layouts might support broadband behavior.

This document is intentionally high‑level and omits implementation details that may be part of ongoing patent work.
