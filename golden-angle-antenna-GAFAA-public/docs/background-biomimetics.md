# Biomimetic Background (Public)

Phyllotaxis describes how plants arrange leaves or seeds to make efficient use of space. The “golden angle” is often cited as a spacing that avoids simple repetition and overlaps.

Engineers have explored spiral and fractal antennas for many years. This project continues that tradition by using nature‑inspired layouts as a starting point for new array geometries.

References include general work on spiral and aperiodic arrays, not specific to any proprietary design.
