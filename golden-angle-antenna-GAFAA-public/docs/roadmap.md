# Public Roadmap

Short‑term (public):

- Maintain safe, educational demos for phyllotactic point sets.
- Add generic, low‑fidelity array‑factor visualizations.
- Document non‑sensitive design questions for future research.

Private roadmap items (full simulations, fabrication studies, patent drafting) are kept outside this repository.
