# Golden-Angle Fractal Antenna Array (GAFAA) – Public Concept Repo

This repository presents a high-level, non‑proprietary overview of the **Golden‑Angle Fractal Antenna Array (GAFAA)** concept.

GAFAA is an antenna architecture *inspired* by phyllotaxis: the spiral patterns seen in sunflowers and pinecones. The idea is to explore how aperiodic, golden‑angle‑like spacing might help reduce interference and improve spectral use in dense communication systems.

See [images/gafaa_121_clean.png](images/gafaa_121_clean.png) for accurate 121-node pattern with golden angle 137.508°.

> Important: This repo is **conceptual only**. It does **not** contain full device specifications, patent claim language, or production‑grade designs. Those details are maintained separately and may be the subject of patent filings.

## Goals (Public Repo)

- Share safe, educational material on phyllotactic / golden‑angle spirals.
- Provide simple Python demos that generate spiral point sets and toy array‑factor plots.
- Offer a public reference for collaboration discussions without revealing sensitive IP.

## What Is *Not* Here

- No full GAFAA specifications (exact geometries, stackups, or dimensions).
- No detailed simulation code tied to specific claimed designs.
- No patent claim wording or IP strategy documents.

If you are interested in deeper collaboration or access to more detailed material, please reach out privately under NDA.
