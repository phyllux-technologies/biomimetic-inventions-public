## 🔐 What the INVENTORSHIP_DECLARATION Does

This is your **failsafe document**. It:

✅ **Declares you as sole inventor** under penalty of perjury  
✅ **Establishes timeline** of conception and development  
✅ **Warns against false claims** by others  
✅ **Creates legal evidence** for patent proceedings  
✅ **Protects against misconduct** like:
   - Others claiming they invented it
   - Patent trolls trying to file on your work
   - Competitors claiming joint inventorship
   - False accusations

It's intentionally named formally ("INVENTORSHIP_DECLARATION") to sound official and intimidating to anyone thinking about misconduct.
