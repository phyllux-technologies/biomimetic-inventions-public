# PhiKey (Golden Lattice Security Protocol)

Quantum-resistant encryption via golden-angle phyllotactic lattices. Biomimetic, irreversible key generation inspired by nature's spirals.

Formerly GeoKey – renamed for clarity and branding.

## Specs
- Lattice: 121 nodes (11x11), growth with golden angle (137.5°).
- Full details in docs/PhiKey_Whitepaper.md

## Code
code.py for key generation simulation and lattice visualization.

## Images
Run code.py to generate images/phikey_lattice.png
